📖 Personal Library System (Console-Based)
🔧 Objective:
Create a program to manage a personal list of books, including adding, updating, removing, and listing books with their read status.

🧠 Step-by-Step Guide (no code, just direction):
✅ Step 1: Plan Your Data Structure
Think about how to represent a book:
A good choice is a dictionary with:

Title

Author

Read status (e.g., "Read" or "Unread")

Then store each book dictionary inside a list, which will be your library.

⚙️ Step 2: Build Core Functions
Create separate functions for each operation:

Add a new book

Ask the user for title and author.

Default status: "Unread"

Append the book to your library list.

Display all books

Loop through your list and print each book’s details clearly.

Number them so it's easier for the user to reference later.

Update read status

Ask the user to choose a book (by number or title).

Change the status to "Read" or "Unread".

Remove a book

Ask for a book to remove (again by number or title).

Delete that item from your list.

Search/filter

Optional: filter by status (e.g., show only unread books)

🔁 Step 3: Create a Menu Loop
Build a loop that runs until the user chooses to exit.

Display options like:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Add a book
2. View all books
3. Update book status
4. Remove a book
5. Exit
Inside the loop, ask the user to choose an action and call the corresponding function.

🧪 Step 4: Test Interactions
Try adding several books.

Update the status of a few.

Remove one and see if the list updates correctly.

Try edge cases: removing a book that doesn't exist, or entering invalid input.

🌟 Optional Enhancements (for extra challenge):
Save and load the library to/from a file (e.g., using JSON or text)

Sort books alphabetically

Add tags or genres

Add a search function (by title or author)

Allow bulk updates (e.g., mark all as read)
